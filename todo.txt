 * Sub component source code is not shown
 * Any component Figma code is not shown
 * Rewrite parser, add new features / fixes is a pain (AST)
 * Code cleaning (multithreaded (always NO_CONCURRENT) flag may need to be cleaned off as I just cannot maintain all flag combos)
 * MCU generation logging should be async
 * Tons of warnings that means either file exits, it conflicst or futile work is done
 * Why it is so slow, how to speed up?
 * Qt for MCU font support (see https://doc.qt.io/QtForMCUs-2.5/qtul-fonts.html#fontmaps)
